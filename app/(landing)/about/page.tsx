          <p className="site_text">The workshop, Kahang Pikre, is one of the prominent producers in the woodworking industry, crafting sculptures from wood, flowers, and cement, with over 15 years of drug experience.
            <br />Among the works carried out in our workshop, the construction of the world's largest Achaemenid chess set is noteworthy. In the year 97, Kahang Pikre commenced the production of wooden vessels, crafting them from a single piece of wood and using hardwoods such as walnut, beech, and others (forest woods).
            <br />The positive and uplifting feeling of wood is the only motivation for the members of Kahang Pikre in the workshop, creating vessels for enthusiasts of wooden utensils, serving as our sole reason to continue the work.
